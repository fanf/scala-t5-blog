A test blog (how imaginative !) in Tapestry 5  and Scala

#Install / Test
---------------

For now, this test use Maven and the Scala-plugin:
http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites/maven-scala-plugin/index.html

You will need at least Maven 2.0.9 to build the project.
So, when maven is installed, simply use the command:

% mvn jetty:run

This command will download the universe (two times), so you can go 
and drink a coffee. When maven is done, you should see something like:

Just go to http://localhost:8080/blog/ 
Your first Tapestry 5 application in Scala is up and running !

When you are done, hit CTRL-C to stop Jetty.

You can also use

% mvn package

To build a war and test it in your preferred application server.
